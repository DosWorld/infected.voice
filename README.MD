# Infected Voice

We proudly present you issues of The Infected Voice - the electronic
magazine for virmakers in Ukraine. Our magazine is well known in the
ex-USSR region - Ukraine, Russia, BieloRussia, Middle Asia. We've issued
ten so far, but, unfortunately, it couldn't reach the World - it was in
the russian language.

Issued 1994 - 2001 in Kyiv (Ukraine).
